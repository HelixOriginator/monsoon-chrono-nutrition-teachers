# Monsoon Chrono-Nutrition Protocol for Night-Owl Teachers

A practical, food-first health guide for private school teachers who sleep late, wake late, and struggle with low energy, weak digestion, and frequent illness during the monsoon months.

This protocol combines chrono-nutrition, meal timing, and seasonal eating into a simple daily routine that fits a teacher’s real schedule.

Designed for real life, not ideal life.

Small daily corrections work better than extreme rules.

Instead of forcing early sleep or strict dieting, this system works with your current rhythm and gently improves it. The goal is steady energy, clarity while teaching, and habits you can sustain through the academic year.
